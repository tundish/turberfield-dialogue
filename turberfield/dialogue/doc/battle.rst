Example 1: Battle Royal
:::::::::::::::::::::::

Launch an interactive session in a fresh window, passing your options file
using the '`@`' syntax, eg:

On Linux or MacOSX::

    $ ~/py3.5/bin/turberfield-rehearse @turberfield/dialogue/sequences/battle/rehearse.cli

On Windows 8.1::

    > start %USERPROFILE%\py3.6\Scripts\turberfield-rehearse @turberfield/dialogue/sequences/battle/rehearse.cli

From now on, I'll assume you know how to operate the command line on your computer.
Further instructions will give the Linux form of commands only, and omit the prompt character.
