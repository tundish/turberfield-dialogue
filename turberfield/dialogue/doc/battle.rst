Example 1: Battle Royal
:::::::::::::::::::::::

Turberfield comes with a couple of examples. We will start with the simplest.
What we learn here will set us up for the more advanced example later.

This is our first encounter with the Turberfield rehearsal tool. We will use
it to preview the action in the first example.

It may be that this is the first time you have launched a Python program from
your computer's command line. If so, there's a couple of things to understand first.

 
Launch an interactive session in a fresh window, passing your options file
using the '`@`' syntax, eg:

On Linux or MacOSX::

    $ ~/py3.5/bin/turberfield-rehearse @turberfield/dialogue/sequences/battle/rehearse.cli

On Windows 8.1::

    > start %USERPROFILE%\py3.6\Scripts\turberfield-rehearse @turberfield/dialogue/sequences/battle/rehearse.cli

From now on, I'll assume you know how to operate the command line on your computer.
Further instructions will give the Linux form of commands only, and omit the prompt character.
