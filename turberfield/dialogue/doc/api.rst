API Reference
:::::::::::::

This API gives you a `simple function`_ for creating a performance from
a :py:class:`~turberfield.dialogue.model.SceneScript.Folder`
of Turberfield dialogue. You can modify how this performance is presented
in your game by customising or replacing a handler_ function which processes
events_ from the scene script files.

The `scene scripts`_ themselves also have an API, allowing you to interact with
the process by which entities are selected and cast to roles.

Folders
=======

.. autoattribute:: turberfield.dialogue.model.SceneScript.Folder
   :annotation: (pkg, description, metadata, paths, interludes)

   :param pkg: The dotted (importable) name of the package which
        installs the scene script folder.

        Absent proper packaging, you must set this parameter to
        `__name__`. The Python module which declares the folder will
        act as the anchor location for scene files, and all
        referencing paths will need to be made relative to the
        module.
   :param str description: A free text description of the contents
        of the folder.
   :param metadata: An optional sequence or mapping containing
        application-specific metadata.

        This parameter is for the purposes of searching or filtering
        collections of folders against particular criteria.
   :param paths: A list of strings, each of which is the path to a
        scene script file relative to the object declared in the
        parameter **pkg**.

        Path separator is always "**/**" notwithstanding the local
        Operating System.
   :param interludes: A sequence of function objects.
        The sequence should be such as to provide one object for
        each of the scene script files declared in the parameter
        **paths**.

        A function object will be called when its corresponding
        scene script file has been performed.

        See `Interludes` for the required signature of an interlude
        function object.

Scene scripts
=============

.. autoclass:: turberfield.dialogue.model.SceneScript
   :members: scripts, read, select, cast, run
   :member-order: bysource

Events
======

.. autoclass:: turberfield.dialogue.model.Model

.. autoattribute:: turberfield.dialogue.model.Model.Shot
   :annotation: (name, scene, items)

   An event which signals the beginning of a shot in a scene.

.. autoattribute:: turberfield.dialogue.model.Model.Property
   :annotation: (entity, object, attr, val)

   An event which signals a property is to be accessed.

.. autoattribute:: turberfield.dialogue.model.Model.Audio
   :annotation: (package, resource, offset, duration, loop)

   An event which signals an audio cue.

.. autoattribute:: turberfield.dialogue.model.Model.Memory
   :annotation: (subject, object, state, text, html)

   An event which signals a memory directive.

.. autoattribute:: turberfield.dialogue.model.Model.Line
   :annotation: (persona, text, html)

   An event which signals a line of dialogue.

Interludes
==========

An interlude is a callable object (either a function, an instance
method or a Python object with a callable interface).

It is called by a handler at the end of the performance of a scene script file.
That is the `current` file as referred to below.

Here is an example to show the signature of parameters required.

.. py:function:: def my_interlude(folder, index, ensemble, log=None, loop=None):

    :param folder: A :py:class:`~turberfield.dialogue.model.SceneScript.Folder` object.
    :param int index: The index position into **folder.paths** of the current
        scene script file.
    :param ensemble: A sequence of Python objects. It is guaranteed to contain
        all the objects cast to roles in the current scene. It will be used to
        select entities for the next.
    :param log: If supplied, this will be a ``logging.Logger`` object which
        should be used in preference over any other for logging messages from within
        your interlude function.
    :param loop: If supplied, this will be an instance of ``asyncio.BaseEventLoop``.
        That will signal to your function that it operates in an asynchronous
        environment and that no blocking function should be called within it.
    :return: A :py:class:`~turberfield.dialogue.model.SceneScript.Folder` object.
        If this is the same object as supplied to the function, it signals that
        performance of this folder should continue. You could return another
        folder to request a branching of the narrative, or else **None** to stop it.

Handler
=======

.. autoclass:: turberfield.dialogue.handlers.TerminalHandler
   :members: handle_audio, handle_interlude, handle_line, handle_memory, handle_property, handle_scene, handle_scenescript, handle_shot
   :member-order: bysource

Player
======

.. autofunction:: turberfield.dialogue.player.rehearse

.. _simple function: py:func:`turberfield.dialogue.player.rehearse`.
