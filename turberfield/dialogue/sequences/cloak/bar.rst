A dingy bar room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


From where you stand
--------------------

[NARRATOR]_

    This is the bar.

[NARRATOR]_

    The room is completely empty now.

Checking your person
--------------------

[CLOAK]_

    Your cloak is 
    like velvet, although that's hard to tell by looking. It is so black
    that its folds and textures cannot be perceived. It seems to swallow all
    light.

Looking around
--------------

[MESSAGE]_

    I am the message.

[NARRATOR]_

    There is a door to the North.
